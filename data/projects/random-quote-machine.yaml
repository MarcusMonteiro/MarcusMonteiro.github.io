description: Use Forismatic's API to fetch a random quote and displays it. The user can click a button to fetch another one. To build this I used React.js . I used a Test-Driven approach, helped by tools such as Jest, Chai and Enzyme. The code is written in ES6 (via Webpack), linted and well organized. For styling, I used React-Bootstrap and Material-UI. To access the API, I used JQuery.
