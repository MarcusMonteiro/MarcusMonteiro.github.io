description: A Pomodoro Clock app in which the user can define session and break lengths. To build this I used React.js . I used a Test-Driven approach, helped by tools such as Jest, Chai and Enzyme. The code is written in ES6 (via Webpack), linted and well organized. For styling, I used React-Bootstrap and Material-UI.
