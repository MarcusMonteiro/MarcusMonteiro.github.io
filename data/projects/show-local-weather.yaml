description: Use OpenWeatherMap's API to fetch information on the weather of the user's current location and displays it. The user can choose between metric and imperial units. To build this I used React.js . I used a Test-Driven approach, helped by tools such as Jest, Chai and Enzyme. The code is written in ES6 (via Webpack), linted and well organized. For styling, I used React-Bootstrap and Material-UI. To access the API, I used JQuery.
