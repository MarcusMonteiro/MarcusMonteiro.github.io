description: As required by the Brazilian law, clients should be able, inside a certain period of time, to confirm or discard an insurance policy hired remotely. The Duplo Sim system is a system I helped build and design to allow them to do just that. We used Cobol, JCL, IBM utilities, SQL (DB2 database), Java (to access the Cobol backend using a technology called "containers"), Angular (for the web application frontend) and native Android APIs for the mobile application.
